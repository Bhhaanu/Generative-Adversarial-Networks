Discriminator Network

The discriminator takes an image as input, and tries to classify it as "real" or "generated". In this sense, it's like any other neural network. We'll use a convolutional neural networks (CNN) which outputs a single number output for every image. We'll use stride of 2 to progressively reduce the size of the output feature map.
